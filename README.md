How This Works:

Matching Engine:
1. Run MatchingEngine.java to generate file output of engine messages (orders recieved, orders executed/match, etc...).
2. Run OrderBook.java to create an OrderBook object and open a locally hosted server with data.

Order Book GUI:
1. Open terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to orderbook-gui file path.
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Run 'npm start' to open a react server with an Order Book display!
