How this works:

1. Matching Engine
   Run MatchingEngine.java to generate file output of engine messages (orders recieved, orders executed/match, etc...).
   Run OrderBook.java to create an OrderBook object and open a locally hosted server with data.

2. Order Book GUI
   Open terminal/command prompt.
   Navigate to orderbook-gui file path.
   Run 'npm install'
   Run 'npm start' to open a react server with an Order Book display!
